# How to Get Code Coverage Data of Native Android (NDK)

### Step 1. Compile your code with code coverage related flag.

Add these two flags into your `Android.mk` file.

	LOCAL_CFLAGS := -g -O0 --coverage
	LOCAL_LDLIBS := --coverage

Then run `ndk-build` to generate the new lib file.

### Step 2. Designate the gcov output directory.

We need this step is because that Android will try to write the information to the directory containing the object files of your app. But most of the time, you have no access to that files. So we need to change the directory to somewhere we can access.

This requires two environment settings. These settings should be set from a native library that is loaded before your main library. So We will define a very small library to do this.

Add a java native method in your java file or just create a new one. Here for an example, I will just use a new one.

com.example.Example.java:

	public class Example{
		public static native initCoverage(String path);
	}
	
The output path is passed in from Java, so you can change it without having to recompile your native code.

Then finish the .c file.

Coverage.c:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <jni.h>
	
	void Java_com_example_Example_initCoverage(JNIEnv* env, jclass class, jstring dataPath) {
		
		const char *dataPathTemp = (*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env, dataPath, NULL);
		
		setenv("GCOV_PREFIX", dataPathTemp, 1);
		setenv("GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP", "123", 1);
		
		(*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, dataPath, dataPathTemp);
	}
	
Android.mk:

	LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
	
	include $(CLEAR_VARS)
	LOCAL_MODULE := Coverage
	LOCAL_SRC_FILES := Coverage.c
	LOCAL_CFLAGS := -std=c99
	include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
	
Make sure you load the coverage library before your main library:

	System.loadLibrary("Coverage");
	initCoverage(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toURI().getPath() + "coverage_data");
	
	System.loadLibrary("Your Main Library");
	
### Step 3. Flush coverage data to file.

Due to the way Android terminates processes, you will need to flush the coverage data manually at some point. This can be accomplished with a call to `__gcov_flush()`. For c and c++ file, there is some differences in how to call it.

For C:

	void __gcov_flush();
	
	int main(void){
		__gcov_flush();
	}

For C++:

	extern "C" void __gcov_flush();
	
	â€¦
	
	call __gcov_flush();

You can check [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19655479/undefined-reference-to-gcov-flush "undefined reference to  '__gcov_flush'") for detail.

### Now you can run your app to get the coverage data.

### Get coverage data to local

If you do it right, you will find the coverage data in `coverage_data` folder under your sdcard in your Android Device.

Copy all the `.gcda` files to the `${PROJECT_HOME}/` folder. This is because for our Android project, the source code file path in 'Android.mk' file is relative path based on `${PROJECT_HOME}`.

Run `arm-linux-androideabi-gcov *.gcda` in that folder to get the `.gcov` file of that cpp file.
